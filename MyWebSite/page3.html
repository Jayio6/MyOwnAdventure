		<p style="border-color:white;border-width:5px;border-style:solid;">The official Solomon R. Guggenheim opened in 1959 and contains one of the most impressive and comprehensive collections of Modern art, spanning mid-19th-century Realism to Postmodern sculpture and installation. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is now one of the wealthiest museums devoted to modern art in the world. Its parent organization, the Guggenheim Foundation, is today a global network of museums that includes world-class facilities in Berlin and Venice.
		<strong>Fun Fact</strong>: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright as a Modernist cathedral for all forms of 19th- and 20th-century art, no matter the medium or mode of representation.
