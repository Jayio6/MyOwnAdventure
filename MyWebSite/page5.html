		<h1>New Museum</h1>

		<h2>Founder: Marcia Tucker</h2>
		<h3>Founded: 1977 </h3>

		<p style="border-color:646765;border-width:5px;border-style:solid;">The New Museum was established by an independent curator Maria Tucker in 1977. It is dedicated to introducing new art and new ideas, by artists who have not yet received significant exposure or recognition. Ever since it was founded, the museum has taken on the mission to challenge the stiff institutionalization of an art museum. It continues to bring new ideas into the art world and to connect with the public.
		On December 1, 2007, the New Museum opened the doors to its new $50 million location at 235 Bowery, between Stanton and Rivington Streets. The seven-story 58,700-square-foot facility, designed by the Tokyo-based firm Sejima + Nishizawa/SANAA and the New York-based firm Gensler, has greatly expanded the museum's exhibitions and space.
